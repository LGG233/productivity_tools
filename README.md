# productivity_tools
A set of productivity tools that I've found useful. Eventually, this repo will include the spreadsheet described [here](https://twitter.com/Colarusso/status/1300438311882887168?s=20), but right now all it has is this [weekly book template](https://colarusso.github.io/productivity_tools/weekly_book/index.html).
